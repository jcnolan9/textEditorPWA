# textEditorPWA

## Description
In this project, given some starter code I turn the existing app into a PWA complete with the ability to install on your machine. Caching means that images and other assets don't
have to re-download in the event of lost connectivity. Using the local IndexedDB means that data (the user's written code in the text editor) is available in the event of an 
internet disconnect and isn't lossed.
